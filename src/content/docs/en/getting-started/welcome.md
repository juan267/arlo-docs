title: Welcome to Arlo Agro
description: Learn about the agricultural management platform that helps you monitor, plan, and optimize your farm operations.
---

Arlo Agro is a comprehensive agricultural management platform designed for perennial crop farms like citrus, avocado, oil palm, cannabis, and coffee. It helps you transform field data into informed decisions.

## Why Arlo?

Modern farms generate enormous amounts of information: pest inspections, labor costs, harvest yields, supply inventories. The problem isn't lack of data—it's the difficulty of organizing, analyzing, and acting on it in time.

Arlo centralizes all this information in a single platform, allowing you to:

- **Detect problems early** with systematic sanitation monitoring
- **Control costs** with structured work cycles
- **Optimize yields** by comparing planned vs. actual performance
- **Make data-driven decisions**, not intuition-based ones

## Key Concept: Cycles as "Sprints"

Arlo uses **cycles** across multiple modules to keep teams focused and moving—similar to sprints in agile methodologies. This is a core concept that differentiates Arlo from other tools.

| Module | Cycle Type | Typical Duration | Purpose |
|--------|------------|------------------|---------|
| **Field Tasks** | Field Cycle | 15 days (configurable) | Bundle work assignments, track budgeted vs. actual costs |
| **Sanitation** | Routes with due dates | Week-by-week | Systematic monitoring with automatic overdue detection |
| **Harvest** | Harvest Cycle | 1-4 weeks | Plan expected yields, compare actual vs. planned performance |

### Why short cycles?

- **Accountability**: Clear deadlines keep everyone focused
- **Quick feedback**: Detect performance issues before they grow
- **Cost control**: Makes financial tracking manageable
- **Course correction**: Allows adjustments before problems escalate

## Arlo Modules

### Sanitation
Systematic monitoring of pests, diseases, and crop health. Create custom inspection forms, schedule weekly routes, collect data offline, and analyze results with heat maps and AI-powered reports.

### Field Tasks
Labor and contractor management. Define field tasks, assign them to cycles with budgets, log completed work, and compare projected vs. actual costs.

### Supplies
Inventory control for fertilizers, agrochemicals, and materials. Track purchases, consumption, and stock by warehouse using the WAVCO (Weighted Average Cost) method.

### Harvest
Harvest planning and tracking. Define cycles with expected yields, record scale weights, and analyze performance by lot, group, and period.

### Statements
Professional shipment documentation for clients. Generate statements linked to your harvest and maintain a clear record of what was sold.

### Custom Forms
Capture any additional data you need with flexible forms for audits, quality checklists, or special inspections.

### Alerts
Smart notification system that alerts you when indicators exceed defined thresholds, so you can act before problems escalate.

## Supported Crops

Arlo is optimized for **perennial crops** where continuous monitoring and long-term planning are essential:

- **Citrus** (orange, lemon, mandarin, grapefruit)
- **Avocado**
- **Oil palm**
- **Cannabis**
- **Coffee**
- **Other perennial fruit crops**

The platform adapts to each crop's unique characteristics, including production cycles, specific pests, and relevant yield metrics.
