**Contractors** (Contratistas) are the individuals or companies responsible for performing specific jobs on your finca. In the Field Tasks module, every piece of work is assigned to a contractor, allowing you to track exactly who is doing what, how much they should be paid, and how efficient they are.

## 1. Creating a Contractor

To register a new contractor, navigate to **Farm → Contractors** and click on **Add Contractor**.

### Field Meanings

When filling out the creation form, keep in mind the following:

- **Name:** The full name of the worker or the company name. This is how they will appear in dropdowns and reports.
- **Contractor Type:**
  - **Field Worker:** Standard workers who perform tasks like pruning, weeding, or fertilizing.
  - **Harvester:** Specialized workers or crews focused on harvest operations.
  - **Other:** Any other type of external service provider.
- **Document ID:** The legal identification number (NIT, CC, or ID). This is crucial for formal payment records and generated PDFs.
- **Email & Phone:** Contact information. While optional, providing an email allows the system to send notifications or reports if configured.
- **Address:** The physical location of the contractor.

## 2. Managing Your Workforce

Once created, contractors can be assigned to **Field Cycle Line Items**.

### Why is this important?

By assigning work to specific contractors, the system can:

1.  **Generate Payment Reports:** Create a PDF summary of all work completed by a specific person within a cycle.
2.  **Track Efficiency:** Compare how different contractors perform the same task (e.g., who is faster at "Plateo" while maintaining quality).
3.  **Audit Work:** Link every field log back to the person responsible for the execution.

:::tip[Pro Tip]
If you have internal employees whom you pay per unit of work (destajo), you should also register them as **Contractors** to take advantage of the cost tracking and automated payment summaries.
