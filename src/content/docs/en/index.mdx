## Key Concept: Cycles

Arlo uses **cycles** across multiple modules to keep teams focused—similar to sprints in agile methodologies. Each module has its own cycle type with configurable duration.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Field Cycles" icon="seti:clock">
    **15 days typical** — Bundle tasks, assign contractors, compare budget vs. actual cost.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sanitation Routes" icon="magnifier">
    **Weekly** — Systematic monitoring with due dates and automatic overdue detection.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Harvest Cycles" icon="star">
    **1-4 weeks** — Plan expected yields and compare with actual results.
  </Card>
