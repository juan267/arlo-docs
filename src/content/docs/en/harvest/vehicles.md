**Vehicles** are the primary assets used to transport harvested crops from the lots to the weighing station. Registering your vehicles accurately is crucial because the system uses their "empty weight" (tare) to calculate the net weight of each harvest entry.

## 1. Why Vehicles are Needed

In a standard harvest workflow, a vehicle is weighed twice:

1.  **Full:** When it arrives from the lot with the harvested crop.
2.  **Empty:** After it has unloaded the crop.

By registering your vehicles in the system, you can store their standard **Empty Weight**. When recording a Harvest Entry, the system can automatically suggest this weight, reducing data entry errors and speeding up the process at the scale.

## 2. Managing Vehicles

Navigate to **Harvest → Vehicles**.

### Creating a Vehicle

Click **Add Vehicle** and fill in the following fields:

- **Name:** A descriptive name (e.g., "Main Truck", "Tractor A").
- **License Plate:** The official identifier for the vehicle. This must be unique within your farm.
- **Capacity:** The maximum weight the vehicle can carry. This is used for reporting and capacity planning.
- **Description:** Any additional notes (e.g., "Assigned to North Lot").

### Empty Weight Suggestion

When you record a **Harvest Entry** for the first time in a day for a specific vehicle, you will enter its current empty weight. For subsequent entries on the **same day**, the system will remember that weight and suggest it automatically, ensuring consistency across multiple trips.

## 3. Best Practices

- **Regular Weighing:** Periodically re-weigh your vehicles without fuel or with a full tank to ensure the "Empty Weight" in the system remains accurate.
- **Consistent Naming:** Use clear names that are easily recognizable by the scale operator.
- **Update Capacity:** If a vehicle is modified (e.g., a larger bed is added), update its capacity and license plate if necessary.
