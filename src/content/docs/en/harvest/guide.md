description: A complete guide to the harvest workflow and how to analyze results using reports.

This guide walks you through the complete harvest workflow, from initial setup to high-level analysis. By following this process, you can ensure that your farm's productivity is accurately tracked and optimized.

## 1. The Complete Workflow

### Phase 1: Setup (The Foundation)

Before harvesting starts, define your assets:

1.  **Vehicles:** Register trucks/tractors and their empty weights.
2.  **Groups:** Organize pickers into teams (e.g., "Team Alpha", "Contractors").
3.  **Units:** Define your containers (e.g., "25kg Crates").

### Phase 2: Planning (The Target)

Create a **Harvest Cycle** and fill the **Harvest Schedule**. This sets the "Expectation" for the period.

- Assign specific groups to specific lots.
- Estimate quantities based on historical data or field observations.

### Phase 3: Execution (The Reality)

As trucks arrive from the field:

1.  Go to **Harvest Entries**.
2.  Record the total scale weight and the number of units.
3.  The system automatically calculates the net weight and updates the **Harvest Actuals**.

### Phase 4: Monitoring (The Adjustment)

Check the **Harvest Cycle** dashboard daily.

- Look for **Amber** status: Why is this lot underperforming?
- Look for **Blue** status: Is this lot yielding more than expected, or was the plan too conservative?

## 2. Analyzing Results with Reports

Navigate to **Harvest → Reports**. This dashboard provides a birds-eye view of your entire harvest operation over any time period.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Total Harvest Weight:** Your total farm yield.
- **Plan vs. Actual:** The overall accuracy of your planning.
- **Avg Daily Harvest:** How much your farm produces on an average day.
- **Shipment vs. Harvest Ratio:** What percentage of harvested crop has successfully left the farm.

### Visual Analysis

- **Harvest by Week:** Identify peak harvest times and seasonal trends.
- **Lot Performance:** A table ranking lots by how well they met their plans.
- **Kg per Square Meter:** A critical efficiency metric that normalizes yield by the size of the lot.
- **Harvest per Group:** Compare which teams are most productive.
- **Vehicle Efficiency:** See which vehicles are making the most trips and carrying the heaviest loads.

## 3. Real-World Insights

### Identifying Hotspots

By looking at the **Lot Performance** and **Kg per SQM** tables, you can identify which areas of your farm are over-performing. This helps you understand which varieties or management techniques are most successful.

### Managing Logistics

The **Shipments vs. Harvest** chart helps you ensure that your warehouse isn't becoming a bottleneck. If the "Harvested" line is much higher than the "Shipped" line, you may need to increase your transportation capacity or client deliveries.

### Quality Control

The **Avg Unit Weight over Time** chart is a hidden gem for quality. If the average weight per crate is dropping, it might mean the fruit size is smaller, or workers are not filling the containers completely.

## 4. Best Practices for Success

1.  **Consistency is King:** Ensure that everyone uses the same naming conventions for lots and groups.
2.  **Daily Reviews:** Spend 5 minutes every morning reviewing the previous day's **Plan vs. Actual**.
3.  **Refine your Units:** If your "Avg Unit Weight" is consistently different from your "Unit Capacity," update the capacity in **Harvest Units** to make future plans more accurate.
4.  **Use Quick Filters:** Use the "This Month" or "This Quarter" buttons in the Reports to quickly compare performance against the same period last year.
