title: Harvest Groups
description: Organize your harvesters into teams for better tracking and analysis.
---

**Harvest Groups** represent the different teams, shifts, or categories of workers performing the harvest (e.g., "Morning Crew", "Premium Team", "Contractor Group A"). Organizing workers into groups allows you to analyze productivity and performance across different teams.

## 1. Why Use Harvest Groups?

Managing harvest through groups provides clear operational benefits:

- **Team Performance:** Compare the efficiency and total weight collected by different teams.
- **Accountability:** Easily track which supervisor or team was responsible for a specific lot or timeframe.
- **Visual Organization:** Use distinct colors to quickly identify different teams in calendars and reports.

## 2. Managing Harvest Groups

Navigate to **Harvest → Harvest Groups**.

### Creating a Harvest Group

Click **Add Harvest Group** and provide the following details:

- **Name:** A unique name for the group (e.g., "North Lot Crew").
- **Supervisor:** (Optional) The name of the person in charge of the group.
- **Color:** Select a color to represent this group. This color will be used in the Harvest Calendar and performance charts.
- **Description:** Additional notes about the group's composition or schedule.

## 3. How they are used

- **Scheduling:** You assign a Harvest Group to a specific **Harvest Schedule**. This tells the system which team is expected to be in which lot on a given day.
- **Entries:** When recording a **Harvest Entry**, you select the group that performed the work. This links the actual weight and units to that specific team.
- **Performance Analysis:** The system aggregates data to show you:
  - Total weight harvested per group.
  - Average units per entry per group.
  - Comparison of actual vs. planned performance for each team.

## 4. Best Practices

- **Stable Groups:** Try to keep group memberships relatively stable over a harvest cycle to get more meaningful longitudinal data.
- **Clear Naming:** Use names that reflect the group's function, location, or shift.
- **Color Coding:** Use high-contrast colors to make it easy to distinguish between groups on the calendar.
