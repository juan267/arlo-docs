The **Sanitation Calendar** is your central hub for planning and monitoring field work. It provides a visual timeline of all past, present, and future sanitation routes, helping you stay organized and ensure your finca is being monitored consistently.

## Overview
The calendar allows you to see all your sanitation activities at a glance. Each entry is color-coded according to its **Sanitation Form**, making it easy to identify different types of monitoring (e.g., Mites, Ants, Diseases) without reading every label.

## Scheduling and Programming Work
Planning ahead is easy with the calendar's scheduling features:

1.  **Add a Route**: Click the plus (+) button on any day (today or in the future).
2.  **Fill the Details**: A window will open where you can select:
    - The **Lot** to be inspected.
    - The **Sanitation Form** to be used.
    - The **Monitor** (inspector) assigned to the task.
3.  **Confirm**: Once saved, the route will appear on that day as "Scheduled."

By programming routes in advance, your field team knows exactly what needs to be done each day when they open the Arlo mobile app.

## Tracking Progress
The calendar uses visual cues to show the status of your work:

### Route Statuses
Each route card displays a badge indicating its current state:
- **Scheduled**: Programmed but not yet started.
- **In Progress**: The monitor is currently performing the inspection in the field.
- **Completed**: The data has been collected and uploaded.
- **Overdue**: The scheduled date has passed, and the route was not completed.
- **Canceled**: The route was removed from the schedule.

### Date Deviations
If a route was scheduled for one day but actually completed on another, a **Warning Badge** (⚠️) will appear. This helps you identify if work is being delayed or if the team is falling behind the original plan.

## Filtering and Ordering
To find specific information in a busy calendar, you can use the built-in filters and sorting options:

### Sorting: Due Date vs. Completion Date
At the top of the calendar, you can toggle between two views:
- **Due Date (Fecha Programada)**: Shows work based on when it was *supposed* to happen. Great for planning.
- **Completion Date (Fecha de Realización)**: Shows work based on when it *actually* happened. Great for auditing and payroll.

### Powerful Filters
Use the filter sidebar to narrow down your view:
- **Quick Dates**: Buttons to quickly jump to "Today", "This Week", or "This Month".
- **By Form**: See only "Mite Monitoring" routes, for example.
- **By Lot**: Focus on a specific area of your finca.
- **By Monitor**: Track the workload of a specific field worker.
- **By Status**: See only "Overdue" or "Completed" routes.

## Navigating to Details
The calendar is interactive. If you want to see the specific data collected during a route (GPS points, photos, pest counts), simply **click on the route card**. It will take you directly to the Route Details page where you can review the full report and map.
