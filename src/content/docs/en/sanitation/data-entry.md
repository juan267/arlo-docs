title: Field Data Collection
description: Learn how to use the mobile-optimized forms to collect sanitation data in the field.
---

The **Field Data Entry** screen is where monitors record their findings as they walk through the finca. This interface is designed for speed and ease of use on mobile devices, even with gloves or in bright sunlight.

## Navigating the Workflow

Depending on how the **Sanitation Form** was configured, the system will guide you through a specific sequence of screens:

1.  **Route Level**: General questions about the entire lot (e.g., Weather).
2.  **Tree Level**: Observations for a specific tree or finding.
3.  **Sample Level**: Detailed measurements for individual samples (e.g., specific leaves or fruits).

The system automatically handles the transitions. For example, if you need to inspect 4 sections per tree, it will show you the **Sample Level** screen 4 times before moving to the next tree.

## Tracking Your Progress

At the top of the screen, you will see a **Progress Card** that keeps you informed about your current position in the route:

-   **Route Progress**: Shows which tree you are currently on out of the total scheduled (e.g., Tree 5 / 10).
-   **Tree Progress**: Shows which section of the tree you are inspecting (e.g., Section 2 / 4).
-   **Sample Progress**: Shows how many samples you have taken in the current section.

:::note[Open-Ended Routes]
If the route is **Open-Ended**, the total number of trees is not fixed. The progress bar will simply count up as you log new findings.

## Filling out the Form

### Field Types
You will encounter different types of fields (Numbers, Checkboxes, Lists, etc.). 
-   **Colors**: Some fields may have background colors to help you group related observations quickly.
-   **Conditional Fields**: Some questions might only appear based on previous answers (e.g., a "Photo" field appearing only if you mark "Pest Found").

### GPS and Connectivity
-   **GPS Tracking**: The system automatically records your location every time you save a data point. 
-   **Connectivity Icons**: You will see a **Wifi Icon** in the bottom bar. 
    -   **Blue (Online)**: Data is being synced to the server in real-time.
    -   **Red (Offline)**: You are currently disconnected; data is being saved safely on your device and will sync later.

## Pausing and Completing

At the bottom of the screen (the "Dock"), you have three main actions:

1.  **Pause (⏸️)**: If you need to stop for a break or a phone call, click the pause icon. Your progress is saved locally, and you can resume later from the **Route Launcher**.
2.  **Connectivity Status**: Indicates if your device is currently communicating with the Arlo servers.
3.  **Next / Save (➡️)**: After filling out the fields, click the arrow to save and move to the next step.

### Completing the Route
When you reach the final sample of the final tree, the "Next" button will change to a **Complete** action. Once clicked, the route is moved to the "Completed" section of the **Route Launcher**, ready for final upload.
