Sanitation Monitors are the people in charge of performing inspections and collecting data in the field. To keep your farm's sanitation data organized, you need to register these monitors in the system so you can assign them to specific routes.

## What is a Sanitation Monitor?

A monitor is typically a field worker or an inspector who walks through the farm lots to check for pests, diseases, or other health indicators in your crops.

By registering them in the system, you can:
- **Track Accountability**: Know exactly who performed each inspection.
- **Assign Routes**: Schedule specific tasks for specific people.
- **Report on Performance**: See how many routes each monitor has completed.

## How to Create a Sanitation Monitor

Adding a new monitor to your farm is a simple process:

1. **Navigate to Sanitation Monitors**: In your farm's side menu, look for the **Sanitation** section and click on **Monitors**.
2. **Click "Add Sanitation Monitor"**: Look for the button with a plus sign (+) at the top of the page.
3. **Fill in the Details**:
   - **Name**: The full name of the monitor (Required).
   - **Code**: A unique identifier or employee ID (Optional).
   - **Document**: An ID number or official document (Optional).
   - **Phone**: A contact number for the monitor (Optional).
4. **Save**: Click the save button to register the monitor.

Once saved, the monitor will appear in the list and will be available for selection when starting a new sanitation route.

## Managing Monitors

From the Monitors list, you can:
- **View All Monitors**: See a list of everyone registered to your farm.
- **Edit Details**: Click the pencil icon next to a monitor's name to update their information.
- **Search and Filter**: Easily find specific monitors by their name or code.

:::tip[Good to Know]
