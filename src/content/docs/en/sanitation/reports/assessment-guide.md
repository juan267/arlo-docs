A successful sanitation program isn't just about collecting data; it's about closing the loop between **Planning, Execution, and Analysis**. This guide explains how to use every tool in the Sanitation module together to ensure your farm is protected.

## The Sanitation Workflow Cycle

To get the most out of the system, we recommend a weekly cycle that follows these four phases:

### Phase 1: Planning & Scheduling (Calendar)
Start your week at the **Sanitation Calendar**.
- **Analyze Gaps:** Look at the previous week. Were any routes missed or delayed?
- **Prioritize:** Use the **Coverage Matrix** (from Analytical Reports) to identify lots with a "Red Status" (not visited in 2+ periods).
- **Schedule:** Create new routes for the week, assigning specific monitors to the high-priority lots.

### Phase 2: Execution & Quality Control (Launcher & Data Entry)
Monitor the work as it happens.
- **Downloading:** Ensure monitors have downloaded the latest forms in the **Route Launcher**.
- **Real-time Progress:** Check the **Sanitation Calendar** or **Map Reports** to see "In Progress" routes.
- **GPS Verification:** Use the **Map Reports** to see the actual path taken by monitors. If a monitor claims to have scouted a lot but the map shows they only walked the perimeter, you have a quality issue to address.

### Phase 3: Immediate Response (Route Analysis & Alerts)
As soon as a route is uploaded:
- **AI Debrief:** Read the AI-generated summary for the route. It will highlight the most critical findings without you having to look at every tree.
- **Alerts:** Check the "Triggered Alerts" section. If a threshold was crossed (e.g., more than 5 mites per leaf), initiate a treatment order immediately.
- **Visual Evidence:** Review photos attached to findings to confirm the severity of the issue.

### Phase 4: Strategic Assessment (Map & Analytical Reports)
At the end of the week or month, perform a "Big Picture" audit:

#### 1. Finding the Source (Spatial Analysis)
Use **Map Reports** with **Heatmaps** enabled.
- **The "Wildfire" Check:** Is the infestation concentrated in one corner, or is it scattered? Concentrated spots suggest a local source (like a neighboring farm or a specific irrigation line), while scattered spots might suggest wind-borne pests.
- **Lot Boundaries:** Do hot spots stop at lot boundaries? If they cross over, your treatment must cover both lots simultaneously to be effective.

#### 2. Analyzing Trends (Statistical Analysis)
Use **Analytical Reports** -> **Findings Tab**.
- **The "Victory" Check:** Look at the Line Charts for your main pests. If the average count is trending down over the last 4 weeks, your previous treatments worked.
- **Alert Compliance:** Check the red dashed line. How often are you staying below the action threshold?

#### 3. Optimizing the Team (Operations Tab)
- **Scouting Speed:** Look at "Average Time per Tree." 
    - **Too Fast:** If a monitor spends less than 30 seconds on a complex tree, they might be missing pests.
    - **Too Slow:** They might need more training on identification or better route planning.
- **Consistency:** Compare monitors. If one monitor always finds 2x more pests than others in the same lot, perform a joint inspection to calibrate their scouting criteria.

## Using the AI Q&A Assistant for the Final Audit

Before presenting your findings to the farm manager, open the **Ask AI** sidebar in the Analytical Reports:

1.  **Ask for Correlations:** *"Is there a relationship between the lots with the lowest coverage and the highest pest pressure?"*
2.  **Ask for a Summary:** *"Based on the last 30 days, what are the top 3 sanitation risks I should include in my monthly report?"*
3.  **Ask for Efficiency Insights:** *"Which monitors are spending the most time in the field but finding the least data?"*

## Summary Checklist for a Full Assessment
- [ ] **Coverage:** Are there any "Needs Attention" (Red) lots in the matrix?
- [ ] **Hotspots:** Where are the red zones in the heatmap?
- [ ] **Trends:** Is the pest pressure increasing or decreasing compared to last month?
- [ ] **Quality:** Do the route paths on the map cover the entire lot area?
- [ ] **Action:** Have all triggered alerts been acknowledged and addressed?
