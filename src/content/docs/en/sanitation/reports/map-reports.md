The **Sanitation Map Report** is your most powerful tool for high-level analysis. Instead of looking at a single day's work, it allows you to combine data from multiple routes, lots, and time periods to see the "big picture" of pest pressure and inspection coverage across your entire finca.

## 1. Setting Up Your View (Filters)

To get started, you must first tell the system what data you want to analyze. The filter panel on the left is your control center:

### Choosing a Sanitation Form
The most important filter is the **Sanitation Form**. You must select one to see data, as each report is specific to the questions asked in that form (e.g., "Mite Monitoring" vs. "Ant Scouting").

### Selecting Multiple Lots
You don't have to look at one lot at a time.
- **Select Specific Lots:** Open the dropdown and check all the lots you want to include.
- **Search:** Use the search bar inside the dropdown to find a lot quickly.
- **Eagle-eye:** If you leave it empty, it will show data for all lots covered by the matching routes.
- **Management:** Selected lots appear as "badges" below the filter, where you can easily remove them one by one.

### Date Range and Time Grouping
- **Date Range:** Select a predefined period (Last 30 days, Year to Date, etc.) or a custom range.
- **Time Grouping:** This is crucial for the "Statistics by Period" section. You can choose to group your data by **Day**, **Week**, or **Month** to see how infestations evolve over time.

### Selecting Data Fields (Heatmaps & Markers)
When you select a form, the specific questions (Custom Fields) from that form appear.
- **Toggle Fields:** Click on the "chips" (buttons with icons) to select which data points you want to visualize on the map.
- **Visual Types:** 
    - **Numbers:** Will be shown as **Heatmaps** (hot spots).
    - **Selections:** Will be shown as **Colored Markers**.

## 2. Reading the Map

The map provides an interactive, visual representation of your field data.

### Map Layers and Toggles
In the **top right corner**, you'll find the layer control:
- **Individual Routes:** Toggle specific routes on or off to compare them.
- **Data Fields:** Toggle the visibility of heatmaps or markers for specific questions.
- **Lots:** Show or hide the outlines of your farm's lots.

### Quick Batch Toggles
In the **bottom left corner**, use the quick action buttons:
- **🛤️ Routes:** Instantly show or hide all route paths and tree markers.
- **📊 Fields:** Instantly show or hide all heatmaps and data markers.

### Heatmaps: Finding Hot Spots
Heatmaps use a color gradient to show density or intensity:
- **🔵 Blue:** Low intensity/Low count.
- **🟢 Green/🟡 Yellow:** Moderate levels.
- **🔴 Red:** High intensity (Hot spots).
- **Why use this?** Identify exactly where a pest is concentrating to target your treatments.

## 3. Summaries and Coverage

Below the filters, the system provides a breakdown of the work performed:

### General Stats
- **Total Routes:** How many individual inspection jobs are included.
- **Trees & Samples:** Total volume of data collected.
- **Lots Covered:** How many distinct lots were visited.

### Lot Coverage Progress
The **Lot Coverage** bar is a critical metric. It compares the number of trees inspected against the **total number of trees** in the selected lots.
- **Goal:** If you aim for 10% coverage of a lot, this bar helps you track if your monitors are meeting that quota over the selected period.

## 4. Aggregated Statistics

This section totals all the findings across all selected routes.

- **Presence Fields:** Shows what percentage of the inspected trees had a positive finding (e.g., "Mites Detected in 15% of trees").
- **Multiple Choice:** Shows the distribution of answers (e.g., "Damage Level: 70% Light, 20% Medium, 10% Severe").
- **Numeric Fields:** Shows the **Average** and **Median** values for counts or measurements.

### Statistics by Period
Using the **Time Grouping** filter (Day/Week/Month), you can expand these sections to see how the numbers changed. This is perfect for seeing if an infestation is growing or if a treatment is working.

## 5. From Map to Detail

Found something interesting on the map?
1. **View Routes List:** Click "View Routes List" in the summary to open a sidebar with every individual route.
2. **Deep Dive:** Click any route in that list to go directly to its **Detailed Analysis** page, where you can see photos and AI insights for that specific day.

---

## 6. Pro Tips for Analysis

- **Finding Hot Spots:** Use the **Heatmap** for numeric counts. If you see a large red area spanning across two lots, you know the pest is moving regardless of lot boundaries.
- **Coverage Check:** Turn off "Fields" and look at the **Route Paths**. Any large gaps in the satellite view represent areas of your farm that haven't been scouted recently.
- **Treatment Success:** Filter for the last 90 days and group by **Week**. Look at the "Presence %" for a specific pest. If the bars are getting shorter each week, your pest management strategy is working.
