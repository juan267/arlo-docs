title: Build Forms with AI
description: Use the AI assistant to create inspection forms based on your crop, pests, and agricultural best practices.
---

The **AI Assistant** helps you create sanitation inspection forms without designing them from scratch. Describe what you need to monitor and the AI will generate a complete form with fields, alerts, and optimized structure.

---

## Why Use the AI Assistant?

Creating a good inspection form requires knowledge about:
- Relevant pests and diseases for your crop
- Appropriate sampling methods
- Standard evaluation scales
- Recommended action thresholds

The AI assistant:
- **Knows common pests** of different crops
- **Suggests structures** based on best practices
- **Includes thresholds** according to industry standards
- **Generates complete fields** with appropriate types

---

## How to Use the Assistant

### Access the assistant

1. Go to **Sanitation → Forms**
2. Click **Create with AI** or **AI Assistant**
3. The conversation panel opens

### Describe your need

Write a message describing:
- What crop you have
- What pests or diseases concern you
- What type of inspection you need

### Examples of effective prompts

**Basic:**
```
I need a form to monitor pests in citrus
```

**More specific:**
```
Create a form to monitor HLB, leaf miner,
and mites in a Valencia orange orchard in a tropical zone.
Include symptom evaluation and insect counts.
```

**Detailed:**
```
I need a weekly inspection form for Hass avocado:
- Evaluate thrips in flowers (scale 0-5)
- Monitor Phytophthora in roots
- Check for borers in branches
- Include photo section for anomalies
- Alert if thrips > 3 or there are Phytophthora signs
```

## What the AI Generates

### Form structure

The AI creates a form with:

1. **Descriptive name** based on your request
2. **Route section** with general fields (date, weather, etc.)
3. **Tree section** with specific evaluations
4. **Custom fields** appropriate for each pest
5. **Alerts** with recommended thresholds

### Field types it can generate

| Type | Typical use |
|------|-------------|
| Number | Insect count, damage percentage |
| Selection | Severity level, presence/absence |
| Checkbox | Observed symptoms, previous treatments |
| Photo | Visual evidence of problems |
| Text | Notes and observations |

## Review and Adjust

### The generated form is a draft

The AI generates a starting point you should review:

1. **Review fields**: Do they cover what you need?
2. **Adjust thresholds**: Are they appropriate for your situation?
3. **Add missing fields**: AI may not include everything
4. **Remove unnecessary**: Keep the form focused

### Iterate with the AI

You can continue the conversation to refine:

```
User: Also add cochineal evaluation
AI: [Generates additional fields for cochineal]

User: The leaf miner thresholds are too high for my zone
AI: [Adjusts suggested thresholds]

User: Simplify the HLB section, I only need
      presence/absence
AI: [Reduces HLB fields]
```

## Limitations

### What the AI does well

- Suggest structures based on common crops
- Propose standard fields for known pests
- Generate thresholds based on agricultural literature
- Create coherent and organized forms

### What the AI cannot do

- Know specific conditions of your farm
- Know pest history of your lots
- Determine economic thresholds for your operation
- Replace experienced agronomist judgment

:::caution[Expert review]
Although AI generates useful forms, always review with your technical team before using in production. Thresholds and criteria may need adjustment for your specific context.
