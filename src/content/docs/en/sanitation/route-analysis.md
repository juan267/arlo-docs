title: Analyzing Route Results
description: Learn how to review and analyze the data collected during a sanitation route.
---

Once a sanitation route is completed and uploaded, you can perform a deep analysis of the findings. The **Route Details** page provides a comprehensive overview of the field data, combining AI insights, statistical summaries, and interactive maps.

## General Information
At the top of the page, you will find the basic context of the inspection:
- **Lot & Form**: Which area was inspected and what protocol was used.
- **Monitor**: Who performed the work.
- **Dates**: When the route was scheduled and when it was actually completed.
- **Status**: Indicates if the route was successful or if there were delays.

## Arlo AI: Automated Debrief
Arlo uses artificial intelligence to help you make sense of large amounts of data instantly. The **AI Debrief** section includes:

-   **Summary**: A plain-language overview of the most important findings.
-   **Key Findings**: Highlights specific issues (e.g., "High mite infestation in the North sector") with severity levels (High, Medium, Low) and trends (Increasing, Stable, Decreasing).
-   **Recommended Actions**: Specific, prioritized suggestions on what to do next (e.g., "Prioritize chemical application in Lot A").
-   **Data Quality**: An assessment of how reliable the data is based on the coverage of the lot.

## Triggered Alerts
If you have configured **Alerts** for your forms, any critical conditions met during the route will be displayed here. For example, if the "Average pH" exceeds your threshold, a warning card will appear showing exactly what triggered it.

---

## Statistical Summaries
The system automatically aggregates data from every point collected:

-   **Totals**: Total trees in the lot vs. trees actually inspected.
-   **Section Summaries**: Detailed tables for **Route**, **Tree**, and **Sample** levels.
-   **Aggregations**: For numeric fields, you will see the **Sum**, **Average**, and **Median**. For checkboxes, you will see the **Incidence Percentage** (how many trees were affected).

## Interactive Map Capabilities
The map is a powerful tool for geographic analysis. You can use the following features:

### 1. Layers and Toggles
Use the map controls to toggle different views:
-   **Heatmaps**: Visualize the intensity of a problem (e.g., where the pest pressure is highest).
-   **Markers**: See the exact location of every tree or finding.
-   **Route Path**: See the actual walking path taken by the monitor (useful for verifying coverage).

### 2. Investigating Specific Trees
Every point on the map is interactive. 
-   **Navigate**: Click on a marker to open the **Tree Details** page.
-   **Details**: Here you can see the specific GPS coordinates, all answers provided for that tree, and any photos taken at that exact spot.
-   **Google Maps**: Use the "Directions" link to get GPS navigation back to that exact tree in the field.

## Visual Evidence
If photos were taken during the route, you can access them via the **View Images and Files** button. This opens a side drawer where you can browse all photographic evidence organized by tree and section.
