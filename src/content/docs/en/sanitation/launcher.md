The **Route Launcher** is the primary workspace for monitors and field workers. It is designed to work seamlessly in areas with poor or no internet connectivity, ensuring that data collection never stops.

## How it Works: Offline First

To enable offline work, the system uses your browser's local storage. This means you must **Download** the forms while you have an internet connection before heading out to the field.

### Downloading Forms
1.  **Download All**: Use the "Download All" button at the top to save all available sanitation forms to your device. This ensures you have everything you need before going offline.
2.  **Automatic Updates**: The system automatically checks if a form has been modified on the server. If an update is detected, you will see a notice, and you should click "Download All" again to get the latest versions.

## Starting a New Route

Once a form is downloaded, you can start a new inspection:
1.  Locate the form in the **New Route Forms** list.
2.  Click **Start Route**.
3.  Select the **Lot** and the **Monitor** assigned to the route.
4.  The system will transition to the data collection screens.

## Managing Your Routes

The top section of the launcher, **In-Progress Route Forms**, keeps track of all the work currently stored on your device.

### 1. In Progress Routes
These are routes that you have started but not yet finished.
- **Continue**: Click the play icon (▶️) to pick up exactly where you left off.
- **Delete**: If you made a mistake or the route is no longer needed, use the trash icon to remove it from your device.
- **Upload**: If you want to save what you have so far to the server, you can upload even if the route isn't fully completed.

### 2. Completed Routes
These are routes where all required data has been collected but is still sitting on your device.
- **Upload to Server**: This is the most important step. Click the **Upload** button once you are back in an area with internet. This moves the data from your device to the finca's official reports and maps.

:::warning[Don't Clear Your Browser Cache]
Since your routes are stored locally in your browser, clearing your cache or browsing data before uploading will result in losing any routes that haven't been sent to the server.
