Creating a statement is the final step in the sales process. This guide will walk you through the editor to ensure your documents are accurate and complete.

---

## Step 1: Start a New Statement

Click the **"Add Statement"** button in the Statements dashboard. The system will create a new document in **Draft** status and take you directly to the editor.

---

## Step 2: Company Information

The first section shows your farm's details.

- Ensure your logo and custom header are correct.
- If you need to update your address or tax info, use the "Edit Configuration" link.

---

## Step 3: Select the Client

Choose the buyer from the dropdown menu.

- The client's address, ID, and email will appear instantly.
- If the client is not in the list, you must create them first in the **Clients** module.

---

## Step 4: Fill Custom Fields

Complete any additional information required by your farm (e.g., Driver Name, Seal Number).

- Fields marked with a red asterisk `*` are **required**.
- You won't be able to finalize the statement until these are filled.

## Step 5: Add Line Items (Products)

This is where you specify exactly what is being sold. Click **"Add Line Item"** for each product type.

For each item, you must select:

1.  **Lot**: The specific area of the farm where the product was harvested.
2.  **Crop Quality**: The grade of the product (e.g., Export, National, Industrial).
3.  **Weight (kg)**: The total amount sold.
4.  **Unit Price**: The price per kilogram.

The system will **automatically calculate** the total price for each line and the overall total for the entire document.

## Step 6: Review and Finalize

Before completing the document, double-check all weights and prices.

### Changing the Status

When you are ready, scroll to the **Status** section at the bottom:

1.  Change the status from "Draft" to **"Completed"**.
2.  The system will perform a final validation.
3.  If successful, the statement is saved, a **Serial Number** is assigned, and the PDF is generated.

As soon as you click save with the "Completed" status, the system will email the PDF to the client and your configured recipients. This action cannot be undone.
