description: Learn how to configure your farm's sales statements, including branding, prefixes, and email automation.
---

Before you start creating statements, you should configure your farm's branding and technical settings to ensure professional-looking documents and automated workflows.

Navigate to **Farm Configuration → Statement Configuration** (or **Configuración de Remisiones**) to manage these settings.

---

## 1. Serial Number Prefix

The **Serial Prefix** is a short text code that precedes the unique number of each completed statement (e.g., "REM" for REM-001, REM-002).

- **Consistency**: This helps you organize and identify sales documents easily.
- **Auto-generation**: Once a statement is marked as "Completed", the system automatically assigns the next sequential number using this prefix.

## 2. Branding & Company Information

To make your statements professional, you can customize the visual identity:

### Company Logo

Upload your farm or company logo. This will appear at the top of every generated PDF statement.

### Custom Header

Use the rich text editor to add your company's official information, such as:

- Legal Name and Tax ID (NIT/RUT)
- Certifications (e.g., GlobalG.A.P.)
- Office addresses or contact phone numbers

### Custom Footer

Add information that should appear at the bottom of every page:

- Terms and conditions
- Bank account details for payments
- Legal disclaimers or "Thank you" messages

---

## 3. Email Automation

You can configure the system to automatically send a copy of the completed statement PDF to specific people.

- **Automated Delivery**: When a statement status changes to "Completed", an email is sent to:
  1. The **Client** (if they have an email address).
  2. The **User** who finalized the document.
  3. Any **Additional Recipients** added in the configuration.
- **Centralized Tracking**: Add your accounting department or owner emails here to keep them informed of every sale in real-time.

## 4. Custom Fields

Every farm has different data needs. Use **Custom Fields** to add specific information to your statements that isn't included by default.

Examples of common custom fields:

- **Vehicle License Plate**: For tracking the truck that picked up the product.
- **Driver Name**: Identifying the person responsible for transport.
- **Quality Certificate #**: Linking the sale to a specific laboratory result.
- **Seal Number**: For logistics security.

You can make these fields **required**, ensuring that no statement is completed without this critical information.
