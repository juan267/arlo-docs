description: Manage your client database for efficient sales and statement generation.
---

The **Clients** (Clientes) module acts as your farm's customer database. By maintaining an accurate client list, you can generate sales statements quickly without re-entering the same information every time.

---

## 1. Why Manage Clients?

- **Efficiency**: Select a client from a dropdown in the statement editor, and all their details (Address, Document ID, Email) will populate automatically.
- **Analytics**: Track your sales performance by client to identify your most important buyers.
- **Automation**: Ensure that completed statements are sent to the correct email address automatically.

## 2. Managing Clients

Navigate to **Sales → Clients** to view and manage your list.

### Creating a Client

When adding a new client, you will provide:

- **Name**: The legal or commercial name of the buyer.
- **Document ID**: Tax identification number (e.g., NIT, RUT, or personal ID).
- **Email**: Crucial for automated statement delivery.
- **Phone & Address**: For logistics and official documentation.

:::tip[Client Uniqueness]
The system ensures you don't create duplicate clients by validating that the Name and Email are unique within your farm.

## 3. Using Clients in Statements

When you start a new statement, the **Client Selection** section allows you to pick from your saved list.

- **Drafting**: You can start a statement as a draft without a client.
- **Completion**: A client **must** be assigned before a statement can be marked as "Completed".
