The **Statements List** is your central hub for tracking all sales activity on the farm. It provides a chronological view of every document created, its current status, and quick access to downloads.

## 1. Understanding the Dashboard

The list view shows key information at a glance:

- **Serial**: The unique document number (e.g., ST-105).
- **Client**: Who purchased the products.
- **Completed At**: The date and time the document was finalized.
- **Total Weight**: The sum of all products in the statement (in kg).
- **Total Value**: The final monetary value of the sale.
- **Status**: Whether it's a Draft, Completed, or Canceled.

## 2. Status Workflow

Statements move through a specific lifecycle to ensure data integrity:

| Status        | Description                                                                                                                               |
| :------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Draft**     | The initial state. You can edit every detail, add/remove products, and change the client. No serial number is assigned yet.               |
| **Completed** | Finalized document. It receives a serial number, triggers emails, and generates the final PDF. **Completed statements cannot be edited.** |
| **Canceled**  | A document that was completed but later voided. It maintains its serial number for audit purposes but is marked as invalid.               |

## 3. Searching and Filtering

Use the filters at the top of the page to find specific documents:

- **Status**: View only completed sales or pending drafts.
- **Client**: See everything sold to a specific customer.
- **Date Range**: Filter by "From" and "To" dates to view sales for a specific week or month.

## 4. Actions

- **Add Statement**: Starts a new draft.
- **Edit (Pencil Icon)**: Available only for **Drafts**. Takes you to the editor.
- **Download PDF**: Available for **Completed** and **Canceled** statements.
- **Delete**: You can only delete **Draft** statements. Once a document has a serial number (Completed/Canceled), it cannot be removed from the system to maintain the integrity of your accounting records.
