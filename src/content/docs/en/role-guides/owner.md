As a farm **owner**, your role in Arlo focuses on strategic oversight: ensuring operations progress as planned, identifying significant deviations, and making high-level decisions.

---

## Your Role in Arlo

### What you should do

- Review key metrics regularly
- Monitor significant variances
- Approve budgets and important decisions
- Ensure team uses the platform correctly

### What you DON'T need to do

- Log daily operational data
- Configure sanitation forms
- Create field cycles
- Register inventory entries

Those tasks belong to administrators and supervisors.

## Recommended View: Dashboard

Your main entry point is the **Dashboard**:

```
What to review:

🔴 CRITICAL ALERTS
   → Any red alert requires your attention
   → Verify actions have been taken

📊 YELLOW/RED INDICATORS
   → Costs over budget
   → Yields below target
   → Low sanitation coverage

📈 TRENDS
   → Improving or worsening?
   → Concerning patterns?
```

---

## Recommended Routine

### Daily review (5 minutes)

```
□ Open Dashboard
□ Review new alerts
□ Verify no "reds"
□ If problems → Delegate follow-up
```

### Weekly review (15-30 minutes)

```
□ Complete dashboard
□ Current field cycle progress
□ Actual vs. budgeted cost
□ Week's sanitation summary
□ Brief meeting with admin if deviations
```

### Monthly review (1 hour)

```
□ Complete monthly report
□ Comparison with previous month/year
□ Cost variance analysis
□ Harvest yield evaluation
□ Inventory review (value, turnover)
□ Pending strategic decisions
```
