As a **field supervisor**, you capture field reality in Arlo. Your work ensures data is accurate, complete, and timely so management can make good decisions.

---

## Your Role in Arlo

### What you should do

- Execute or coordinate sanitation inspections
- Log completed work
- Verify contractor work quality
- Report problems or anomalies found
- Sync data promptly

### What you DON'T need to do

- Create forms or configure alerts
- Plan cycles or budgets
- Approve purchases or payments
- Generate executive reports

Those tasks belong to the administrator.

---

## Mobile Work

### Recommended device

- Smartphone or tablet with camera
- Recent Android or iOS
- Active GPS
- Internet connection (at least for syncing)

### Before going to field

```
□ Verify device battery (> 50%)
□ Verify internet connection
□ Download forms/routes for offline work
□ Confirm assigned routes/tasks for today
```

---

## Offline Work

### How it works

1. **With connection**: Download assigned forms and routes
2. **Without connection**: Complete inspections normally
3. **When connection returns**: Sync captured data

### Download for offline

```
Before going to field:
1. Open assigned route
2. Verify form is downloaded
3. Lots with maps also download
4. You'll see "Available offline" indicator
```

### Sync

```
When returning:
1. Connect to WiFi or mobile data
2. Open Arlo
3. Verify "Syncing..." appears
4. Wait for "Data synced" confirmation
5. If error, retry or report to admin
```

:::caution[Don't close app during sync]
Wait for sync to complete before closing. If you close before, you might lose data or need to retry.

## By Module

### Sanitation: Execute Routes

**Your workflow:**

```
1. START OF DAY
   → Open Arlo
   → View assigned routes
   → Download offline forms

2. IN FIELD
   → Open the route
   → Go to first lot
   → Complete form for each tree/point
   → Take photos when needed
   → Repeat for each lot

3. END OF DAY
   → Verify all data is complete
   → Sync data
   → Confirm route appears as "Completed"
```

**Tips for quality data:**

| Do | Avoid |
|----|-------|
| Count precisely | Estimate "by eye" |
| Take clear photos | Blurry or no-context photos |
| Record everything | Omit "minor" findings |
| Sync daily | Accumulate several days |

### Field Tasks: Log Work

**Your workflow:**

```
1. WHEN WORK COMPLETES
   → Verify units actually completed
   → Open field cycle
   → Find corresponding task
   → Add log with:
     - Work date
     - Completed units
     - Notes if observations

2. VERIFICATION
   → Confirm progress updated
   → Sync data
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Can't sync

```
1. Verify internet connection
2. Close and reopen Arlo
3. Try connecting to WiFi
4. If persists, report to admin
5. DO NOT delete app (would lose local data)
```

### Route doesn't appear

```
1. Are you connected? May not have downloaded
2. Is it for today? Verify date
3. Were you assigned? Confirm with admin
4. Try refreshing the list
```

### Made a data mistake

```
1. If not synced yet: Edit directly
2. If already synced:
   - For minor errors: Report to admin for correction
   - For major errors: Document and report immediately
```

## Best Practices

### Quality data

```
✓ Record at the moment, not "later"
✓ Be precise in counts and measurements
✓ Take photos that clearly show findings
✓ Use notes for important context
✓ Sync at end of each day
```

### Time management

```
✓ Plan your route before leaving
✓ Group nearby lots
✓ Charge device night before
✓ Bring portable battery for long days
```

### Communication

```
✓ Report serious problems immediately (call/message)
✓ Minor problems go in Arlo notes
✓ If you can't complete a task, notify before it's late
```

## Photos: When and How

### When to take photos

| Situation | Photo? | Why |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| Pest above threshold | ✓ | Evidence for decision |
| Unusual symptoms | ✓ | Later diagnosis |
| Significant damage | ✓ | Documentation |
| Normal condition | ✗ | Doesn't add information |
| Similar photos exist | ✗ | Avoid redundancy |

### How to take good photos

```
✓ Focus clearly on subject
✓ Include context (plant part visible)
✓ Good lighting (not backlit)
✓ Stable (not blurry)
✓ Close when detail is needed
```
