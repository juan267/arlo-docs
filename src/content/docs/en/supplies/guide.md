title: Supply Management Guide & Reports
description: Learn how to analyze your supply data to find inefficiencies, optimize spending, and ensure operational continuity.
---

The goal of the Supply module is to transform raw inventory data into actionable insights. By combining entries, exits, and reporting tools, you can move from simply "storing items" to "optimizing resources."

## 1. Value of Integrated Supply Management

Using the full suite of supply tools provides several strategic benefits:

- **Financial Control:** Know exactly how much money is sitting in your warehouse at any moment.
- **Operational Continuity:** Prevent work stoppages caused by running out of critical materials (like fertilizer during a peak window).
- **Cost Precision:** Assign real, unit-level costs to every lot and field activity.
- **Supplier Accountability:** Monitor which providers are consistent with pricing and delivery.

## 2. Analyzing Performance with Reports

The **Supply Reports** page (**Insumos → Informes**) is your control center for identifying problems and opportunities.

### Identifying Inefficiencies

- **Consumption by Lot:** If one lot consumes significantly more herbicide than others of the same size, it may indicate a weed problem that needs a different biological approach or poor application quality.
- **Consumption by Contractor:** Compare how different contractors use materials for the same task. If one contractor consistently uses 20% more product to achieve the same result, they may need better training or equipment.
- **Top Supplies by Spending:** Focus your negotiation efforts on the 5 supplies that represent 80% of your budget.

### Monitoring Stock Health

- **Inventory Value Over Time:** A rising line might indicate you are over-stocking and tying up too much capital in the warehouse.
- **Entries vs. Exits Ratio:** Ensure your purchases (Entries) align with your actual needs (Exits). A massive gap could signal waste or theft.
- **Supplies with Stock:** Quickly see if your essential materials are reaching dangerously low levels.

## 3. Real-World Examples

### Example A: Solving a Cost Mystery

A manager notices that the cost of "Pruning" has increased by 15% this month. By looking at the **Consumption by Field Task** report, they see that the cost of "Disinfectant" (used during pruning) has spiked. Further checking the **Supply Show View**, they find that the latest purchase from a new provider was 30% more expensive, affecting the WAVCO.

### Example B: Improving Contractor Performance

By using the **Consumption by Contractor** chart, the farm owner sees that "Contractor A" uses 2 liters of fertilizer per 100 trees, while "Contractor B" uses 2.5 liters. They investigate and find that Contractor B's equipment has a leak, saving the farm hundreds of dollars in wasted material over the next month.

## 4. Best Practices for Reports

1. **Regular Review:** Check your reports at the end of every **Field Cycle** to reconcile planned vs. actual spending.
2. **Use Date Filters:** Compare this month vs. the same month last year to account for seasonal variations.
3. **Export to Excel:** Use the **XLSX Export** buttons for advanced analysis in your own spreadsheets or to share with your accounting department.
