Arlo incorporates **Artificial Intelligence** to help you understand your data faster. Instead of manually analyzing tables and charts, you can get automatically generated summaries, interpretations, and recommendations.

## AI Capabilities in Arlo

### Automatic Summaries (Debriefs)

After completing a sanitation route, AI generates a summary including:
- Main findings
- Values that exceeded thresholds
- Weather context for the period
- Comparison with previous routes
- Action recommendations

### Question Analysis

You can ask questions about your data:

```
User: "How are pest levels this month compared to last month?"

AI: "Overall pest levels increased 15% compared to December.
    Main changes are:

    • Mites: +35% (from 4.2 to 5.7 average)
    • Thrips: +12% (from 2.1 to 2.4 average)
    • Leaf miner: -8% (from 28% to 26% affected shoots)

    The increase coincides with dry season and higher temperatures.
    Recommend adjusting monitoring frequency and reviewing
    alert thresholds."
```

## Where to Find AI Analysis

### In sanitation routes
After completing a route:
1. Go to **Sanitation → Route Analysis**
2. Open a completed route
3. Find the **AI Summary** or **Debrief** section

### In analytical reports
1. Go to **Sanitation → Analytical Reports**
2. Select analysis period
3. Click **Generate AI Analysis**

### Analysis chat (if available)
1. Click on chat or assistant icon
2. Write your question about the data
3. Receive response based on your actual data

## Types of Analysis

### Individual route analysis
Generated automatically when completing a route.

### Period analysis
For time ranges (week, month, quarter):
- Key indicator trends
- Lots with recurring problems
- Effectiveness of previous interventions
- Projections if patterns continue

### Comparative analysis
Comparisons between:
- Lots (which has more problems?)
- Periods (improving or worsening?)
- Crops (which requires more attention?)
- Years (seasonal pattern?)

## Limitations

### What AI does well
- Summarize large amounts of data
- Identify patterns and anomalies
- Compare with historical averages
- Contextualize with weather data
- Suggest actions based on best practices

### What AI cannot do
- Physically inspect crops
- Know unrecorded local circumstances
- Predict the future with certainty
- Replace expert agronomist judgment
- Make decisions for you

:::caution[Human validation]
Always validate AI analysis with direct field observation and agronomic judgment. AI is a support tool, not a substitute for expert knowledge.
